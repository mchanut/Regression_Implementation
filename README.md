# Background

This project is the first assignment of COMP551 : Applied Machine Learning taught by Professor Isabeau Prémont-Schwarz in Fall 2023 at McGill University. 

In this miniproject we will implement two ML models—Linear regression, Logistic regression (with gradient descent)— and provide analysis on these two models on two distinct datasets. The goal is to get started with programming for Machine Learning and learn how these two commonly used models work.
